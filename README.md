# centralised_tracking_of_av
When developing autonomous vehicle functions, scaled cars can be used effectively to test the real-time implementatability of autonomous control algorithms. This project will focus on the development and hardware testing of a centralised traffic management system, using a tracking system and a number of scaled cars.
